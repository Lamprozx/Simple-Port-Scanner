🔥 Simple Python Port Scanner
This is a multi-threaded Python port scanning tool designed for educational purposes, network diagnostics, and authorized security testing.
It helps users understand how TCP ports, services, and basic banner grabbing work in real network environments.

This project is intended for learning cybersecurity fundamentals, penetration testing labs, and personal infrastructure auditing.

✨ Features
⚡ Multi-threaded TCP port scanning
🎯 Manual target input via terminal
📊 Automatic scan report generation
